XDKAirMenu
==========

iOs Menu like the app FIFA

AFNetworking is a delightful networking library for iOS and Mac OS X. It's built on top of the Foundation URL Loading System, extending the powerful high-level networking abstractions built into Cocoa. It has a modular architecture with well-designed, feature-rich APIs that are a joy to use.

Perhaps the most important feature of all, however, is the amazing community of developers who use and contribute to AFNetworking every day. AFNetworking powers some of the most popular and critically-acclaimed apps on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

Choose AFNetworking for your next project, or migrate over your existing projectsâ€”you'll be happy you did!

## How To Get Started

Download XDKAirMenu and try out the included iPhone example app
Check out the documentation for a comprehensive look at all of the functionalities available in XDKAirMenu

### Installation with CocoaPods

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like AFNetworking in your projects. See the "Getting Started" guide for more information.
Podfile

	pod "EZForm"

### Other installation

Git clone the source.

Add XDKAirMenu/XDKAirMenu folder to your project (or workspace).

## Quick start

Import the main header:

	#import <EZForm/EZForm.h> 

Create an EZForm instance and add some EZFormField subclass instances to it. For example:

	- (void)initializeForm
	{
    /*
     * Create EZForm instance to manage the form.
     */
    _myForm = [[EZForm alloc] init];
    _myForm.inputAccessoryType = EZFormInputAccessoryTypeStandard;
    _myForm.delegate = self;

    /*
     * Add an EZFormTextField instance to handle the name field.
     * Enables a validation rule of 1 character minimum.
     * Limits the input text field to 32 characters maximum (when hooked up to a control).
     */
    EZFormTextField *nameField = [[EZFormTextField alloc] initWithKey:@"name"];
    nameField.validationMinCharacters = 1;
    nameField.inputMaxCharacters = 32;
    [_myForm addFormField:nameField];

    /*
     * Add an EZFormTextField instance to handle the email address field.
     * Enables a validation rule that requires an email address format "x@y.z"
     * Limits the input text field to 128 characters maximum and filters input
     * to assist with entering a valid email address (when hooked up to a control).
     */
    EZFormTextField *emailField = [[EZFormTextField alloc] initWithKey:@"email"];
    emailField.inputMaxCharacters = 128;
    [emailField addValidator:EZFormEmailAddressValidator];
    [emailField addInputFilter:EZFormEmailAddressInputFilter];
    [_myForm addFormField:emailField];
	}

You can update the form fields directly based on user input. But, more commonly, you will wire up your input controls directly to EZForm so it will handle input, validation, field navigation, etc, automatically. For example:

- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];

    /* Wire up form fields to user interface elements.
     * This needs to be done after the views are loaded (e.g. in viewDidLoad).
     */
    EZFormTextField *nameField = [_myForm formFieldForKey:@"name"];
    [nameField useTextField:self.nameTextField];

    EZFormTextField *emailField = [_myForm formFieldForKey:@"email"];
    [emailField useTextField:self.emailTextField];

    /* Automatically scroll (or move) the given view if needed to
     * keep the active form field control visible.
     */
    [_myForm autoScrollViewForKeyboardInput:self.tableView];
}

If you wire up any of your views to EZForm you should unwire them in viewDidUnload, which you can do with one method call:

- (void)viewDidUnload
{
    [super viewDidUnload];
    [_myForm unwireUserViews];
}

See the demo app source for more examples of how to work with EZForm.
Demo

A demo universal iOS app is included with the source, containing some example form implementations.

##Documentation

EZForm comes with full API documentation, which is Xcode Document Set ready. Use appledoc to generate and install the document set into Xcode - http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/

To generate the document set using appledoc from the command-line, cd to the root of the source directory and enter:

./gen-apple-doc-set

##Requirements

XDKAirMenu is compatible with iOS 7 and upwards. XDKAirMenu uses automatic reference counting (ARC).

The demo app included with the source requires iOS 7.
